>[!info] *Oblivious algorithm* is an algorithm that is independent of a certain property of the problem (*we want these because they usually mean less branching*)

# Questions to setup note
- [ ] DLP vs TLP
- [ ] the point of AVX extensions is to accelerate carefuly written libraries rather than for the compiler to generate them (is that still true and why)
- [ ] compiler can do this -> not good, limited but platform independent
- [ ] Alt use compiler attributes (how?)
- [ ] SIMD masking with merging/ blending what do these mean???
- [ ] mask vs maskz
- [ ] Tree using blocking / SIMD how do you combine all those blocking techniques???
- [ ] why is aligned usually faster
- [ ] check for changes in week 5 & 6 and ofc their tutorials
- [ ] sorting network. how do they work (bitonic merge do I need to know exactly how it works)
- [ ] 


coverting/  moving data, branches -> trivial things that can cost vector code more instructions
